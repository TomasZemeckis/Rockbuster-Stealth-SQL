# Rockbuster-Stealth-SQL
Analysing data to get the answers to important business questions for their plan of action. I'll use SQL to compare sales across regions, map out customer geography, target high-value customer locations, find the best and worst-performing films, and analyse rental durations.
## Objective
A movie rental firm called Rockbuster Stealth LLC once had locations all over the world. In an attempt to maintain its competitiveness in the face of fierce competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team intends to utilise its current movie licences to introduce an online video rental business.
## Key Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
